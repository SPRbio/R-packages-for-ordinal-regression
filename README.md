# A Systematic Review and Comparative Study of R Packages for Ordinal Response Regression Models

### Manuscript submited in WIREs Computational Statistics

This is the repository for the manuscript "*A Systematic Review and Comparative Study of R Packages for Ordinal Response Regression Models*" that is submited in the journal [WIREs Computational Statistics](https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/19390068).

This study aims to (1) review and describe R packages that can fit ordinal regression models through a Scoping review and (2) compare the functionality and performance of the most widely used and relevant R packagesâ€™ functions among the previous ones in two different contexts (Arthritis and Injury severity analyses).
